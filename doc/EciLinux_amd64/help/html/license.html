End User License Agreement for IXXAT Software Products Provided Free-of-Charge.</a></h2>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    This software license agreement (following named "Agreement") is a legal
    agreement between you and your company ("Client") and
    HMS Technology Center Ravensburg GmbH ("HMS"). By using the software program(s)
    and/or components included in the zip file or other type of
    software-package ("Software"), Client agrees to be bound by the terms of this
    Agreement. If Client does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Software
    and the accompanying items (including any printed materials, binders or other
    containers) shall be promptly un-installed and deleted or destroyed.


    § 1 Scope of Delivery of Software

    1.1 Software is provided as it is. HMS does not guarantee that Software embodies
    all necessary legal provisions and all standards related to the Software.

    1.2 Software is delivered by HMS in a machine-readable format
    (object code or source-code), together with installation instructions and user
    documentation (if provided). Installation instructions and user documentation
    may be provided in electronic format such as PDF only.


    § 2 Right to Use Software 

    2.1 HMS grants to Client the right to use Software to the extent agreed in 
    this agreement. Client may use Software for its own purposes and for the 
    purposes of Client's group of companies. 

    2.2 Software is provided free-of-charge to Client as free supplement to other
    IXXAT software and hardware products offered by HMS.

    2.3 Client is not entitled to distribute nor provide the Software to any 3rd
    party if not explicitly permitted by HMS in writing.

    2.4 The Client agrees to use Software only on configurations that HMS has 
    declared to be compatible with Software.

    2.5 HMS grants Client the right to use Software only in combination with
    standard HMS hardware products or with OEM hardware products available from
    HMS. The usage of Software in combination with 3rd party hardware is prohibited
    unless explicitly permitted by HMS in writing.

    2.6 Client may use Software as for his application or product - this includes
    the development of software-products that exchange data with Software provided
    by HMS. Client shall not be entitled to derive a product from Software that is
    competing with HMS products, solutions or services. 


    § 3 Performance 

    3.1 Client shall be responsible for the installation of Software on its 
    IT-system. 

    3.2 Client shall be responsible for the implementation of Software; Client is 
    also responsible to test Software under the conditions it shall be used before 
    using it productively. 


    § 4 Client's Responsibilities for Software Protection 

    4.1 Client acknowledges that Software and the related documentation - including
    future versions - are copyrighted, and represent confidential information and
    trade secrets proprietary to HMS or to HMS's supplier. Client shall take all
    necessary steps to avoid disclosure of the source-code of Software and the
    related documentation to any third party. If Software is delivered in
    source-code, Client shall make it available to any third party only with HMS's
    permission. Client's obligation shall be permanent. The permission may not be
    unreasonably withheld, but it need not be given to enable Client to obtain
    maintenance from a third party.

    4.2 Client must neither remove nor modify any copyright information of
    Software - especially if provided by HMS in source-code - or of the documentation
    provided with Software. Client is obliged to have the HMS copyright and this
    Agreement directly accessible for users of the Software or Client's product.

    4.3 Client may copy Software only for back-up purposes, for replacement or - if 
    source-code has been delivered - in order to search for defects.

    4.4 Client shall not be entitled to translate, distribute, modify or develop any
    works based on provided user documentation. If documentation is provided not in
    an electronic format, Client may make copies of the documentation only if
    admissible and only for internal purposes.

    4.5 HMS may revoke Client's right of use, if Client substantially violates its
    obligations referring to software protection.


    § 5 Warranty and Maintenance 

    5.1 Software is provided for free without maintenance and warranty. Client may 
    report deficiencies to HMS.

    5.2 HMS may fix deficiencies or develop, update and upgrade Software at its sole
    discretion and without prior announcement. This includes implementation of new
    features and the adaptation to system software.


    § 6 Support 

    6.1 HMS shall not be obliged to provide support for Software. 


    § 7 IXXAT's Liability 

    7.1 HMS, ITS AFFILIATES AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
    WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL
    INJURY, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS
    INFORMATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, OR SOFTWARE RESTORATION, OR ANY OTHER
    PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN
    IF HMS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7.2 IN ANY CASE, THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF HMS, ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS SUPPLIERS',
    UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE
	PAYMENTS MADE BY CLIENT TO HMS FOR THIS SOFTWARE. YOU MAY CLAIM FOR HIGHER
	LIABILITY OF HMS, BUT MUST THEN PAY A THIRD CHARGE FOR THE AGGRAVATED RISK.


    § 8 General Matters 

    8.1 This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties and
    shall not be altered, amended or cancelled, except in writing and with the
	consent and signature of all parties concerned.

    8.2 The parties, if they are merchants by registration, hereby submit to the
    jurisdiction of HMS's main place of business.

    8.3 This Agreement shall conform with and be governed by the laws of Germany.
    The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
    (which has been incorporated into German law) shall not apply to foreign Clients.
